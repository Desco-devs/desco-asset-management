  2. Maintenance report CRUD operations
  3. Document viewing/management
  4. Advanced filtering & search
  5. Maintenance scheduling & alerts

> i think i already have this ❌ Vehicle Deletion API

✻ Thinking…

  The user says they think they already have the Vehicle Deletion API. Let me check the actions.ts file again and search for any delete 
  functionality in the vehicles route to see if there's a delete action that I might have missed.

● Let me check for vehicle deletion functionality in your codebase.

● Search(pattern: "delete.*vehicle|removeVehicle|deleteVehicleAction", path: "src/app/(admin-dashboard)/vehicles", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see there are references to delete functionality in the UI components, but I need to check if there's actually a delete action in the 
  actions.ts file or if there's an API route for deleting vehicles. Let me check:

  1. The actions.ts file I read earlier only had create and update actions
  2. There are UI components that reference delete functionality
  3. I should check for API routes that handle vehicle deletion

  Let me search for the actual delete implementation.

● Search(pattern: "deleteVehicle|delete.*vehicle", path: "src")
  ⎿  Found 11 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/api/vehicles/**")
  ⎿  Found 8 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Found it! There's an API route at /src/app/api/vehicles/[id]/route.ts which likely contains the DELETE method. Let me check this file to see 
  the delete implementation.

● Read(src/app/api/vehicles/[id]/route.ts)
  ⎿  Read 170 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I found the DELETE API endpoint. Let me also check if there are hooks or service files that use this delete functionality to get a 
  complete picture.

● Read(src/hooks/useVehiclesQuery.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me search for the delete vehicle function in that hooks file to see if it's implemented there.

● Search(pattern: "deleteVehicle|useDeleteVehicle", path: "src/hooks/useVehiclesQuery.ts", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So the user is correct - they do have the Vehicle Deletion API already implemented. Let me read those specific lines to confirm the 
  implementation.

● Read(src/hooks/useVehiclesQuery.ts)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  And let me check the mutation hook implementation around line 271:

● Read(src/hooks/useVehiclesQuery.ts)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! The user is absolutely correct. They do have the Vehicle Deletion API already implemented. Let me update the analysis with the correct 
  missing features list.

● You're absolutely correct! ✅ Vehicle Deletion API is already implemented

  Found complete deletion implementation:
  - API route: /api/vehicles/[id] DELETE method (route.ts:131-170)
  - Hook: useDeleteVehicle() with optimistic updates (useVehiclesQuery.ts:271-284)
  - UI integration: Delete buttons in VehicleCards and VehicleModal components
  - Proper cleanup: Deletes related maintenance reports before vehicle deletion
  - Permission-based: Uses withResourcePermission for authorization

  Updated Missing Features List:

  ❌ Maintenance Report CRUD APIs - Server actions missing
  ❌ Advanced Search/Filtering - By status, expiry dates, maintenance history❌ Bulk Operations - Import/export vehicles, bulk status updates
  ❌ Maintenance Scheduling - Preventive maintenance alerts
  ❌ Vehicle Analytics - Usage statistics, maintenance costs
  ❌ Maintenance History Timeline - Visual maintenance tracking❌ Document Management - View/download/replace uploaded files
  ❌ Notification System - Expiry alerts, maintenance reminders
  ❌ Vehicle Assignment - Assign to users/departments

  The highest priority missing feature appears to be Maintenance Report CRUD operations since you have the UI components but need the server
  actions to make them functional.

> i think i laready implemente this   Updated Missing Features List:

    ❌ Maintenance Report CRUD APIs - Server actions missing

✻ Thinking…

  The user is saying they think they already have the Maintenance Report CRUD APIs implemented. Let me check their codebase for maintenance 
  report related APIs and server actions.

  From the earlier grep, I saw files like:
  - /home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/src/app/actions/vehicle-maintenance-actions.ts
  - /home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/src/app/api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/[id]/route.ts
  - /home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/src/app/api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/route.ts

  Let me examine these files to see if maintenance report CRUD is indeed implemented.

● Let me check your maintenance report CRUD implementation:

● Read(src/app/actions/vehicle-maintenance-actions.ts)
  ⎿  Read 484 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/app/api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/route.ts)
  ⎿  Read 163 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check the individual maintenance report route to see if it has PUT and DELETE operations.

● Read(src/app/api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/[id]/route.ts)
  ⎿  Read 252 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see that the user is indeed correct! They have fully implemented the Maintenance Report CRUD APIs. Let me summarize what I found:

  1. Server Actions (vehicle-maintenance-actions.ts):
    - createVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Create maintenance reports with file uploads
    - updateVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Update maintenance reports with file uploads  
    - deleteVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Delete maintenance reports with file cleanup
    - getAllVehicleMaintenanceReportsAction() - Get all maintenance reports for a vehicle
  2. API Routes:
    - /api/vehicles/maintenance-reports - GET (list with filtering), POST (create)
    - /api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/[id] - GET (single report), PUT (update), DELETE
  3. Features included:
    - File upload support for attachments  
    - Permission-based access control
    - Full CRUD operations
    - Filtering and pagination
    - Proper error handling
    - Transaction support for deletions
    - File cleanup on deletion
    - Optimistic UI updates in hooks

  So the user is absolutely right - they already have comprehensive maintenance report CRUD functionality implemented.

  Let me update my analysis and provide the truly missing features.

● You're absolutely right! ✅ Maintenance Report CRUD APIs are fully implemented

  Found comprehensive implementation:

  Server Actions (vehicle-maintenance-actions.ts)
  - createVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Create with file uploads
  - updateVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Update with file management
  - deleteVehicleMaintenanceReportAction() - Delete with file cleanup
  - getAllVehicleMaintenanceReportsAction() - List reports

  API Routes
  - GET/POST /api/vehicles/maintenance-reports - List/create with filtering
  - GET/PUT/DELETE /api/vehicles/maintenance-reports/[id] - Individual report operations

  Features included: File attachments, permission controls, validation, error handling, transactions

  Actually Missing Features (Revised List):

  ❌ Advanced Search/Filtering UI - Filter by expiry dates, maintenance status, location❌ Bulk Operations - Import/export vehicles, bulk status
   updates
  ❌ Maintenance Scheduling - Preventive maintenance alerts & scheduling
  ❌ Vehicle Analytics Dashboard - Usage statistics, maintenance costs, trends
  ❌ Document Management UI - View/download/replace uploaded vehicle documents
  ❌ Notification System - Expiry alerts, maintenance reminders, email notifications❌ Vehicle Assignment System - Assign vehicles to
  users/departments
  ❌ Maintenance Calendar View - Visual scheduling and timeline
  ❌ Cost Tracking - Track maintenance costs, parts costs, labor costs
  ❌ Reporting & Exports - Generate maintenance reports, export to PDF/Excel

  Highest Priority Implementation:
  1. Document Management UI - View/download vehicle images and documents
  2. Advanced Filtering - Enhanced search capabilities
  3. Notification System - Expiry and maintenance alerts
  4. Analytics Dashboard - Vehicle usage and maintenance insights

  Your vehicle system is quite mature with full CRUD operations for both vehicles and maintenance reports!

> ey do this instead  ❌ Reporting & Exports - Generate maintenance reports, export to PDF/Excel and use this pattern
