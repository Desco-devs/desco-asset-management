# Chat System Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation phases for migrating the existing chat system from Socket.io to Supabase realtime.

## Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Database Schema** - Uncomment and enable all chat models in Prisma schema ✅
- [x] **User Authentication Integration** - Ensure chat works with existing auth system ✅
- [x] **Basic Room Management** - Create/list/join rooms functionality ✅
- [x] **Core Messaging** - Send/receive text messages in rooms ✅
<!--

## Phase 2: Real-time Core (High Priority) ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

- [x] **Supabase Realtime Setup** - Complete integration with SupabaseRealtimeProvider wrapper ✅
- [x] **Message Broadcasting** - Full real-time message delivery with optimistic UI updates ✅
- [x] **Room State Sync** - Complete integration with live room updates and invitation notifications ✅
- [x] **Online Presence** - Full presence system with global and room-specific tracking ✅

## Phase 3: User Experience (Medium Priority) ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

- [x] **Room Invitations** - API and basic UI working ✅
- [x] **Message Threading** - Database schema exists, UI not implemented ⚠️
- [x] **Message Pagination** - Basic pagination working ✅
- [x] **Typing Indicators** - Fully integrated with real-time display ✅

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Medium Priority) ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

- [ ] **File Attachments** - Database schema exists, UI not implemented ❌
- [ ] **Message Editing/Deletion** - Not implemented ❌
- [x] **Unread Message Tracking** - Basic unread count working ✅
- [ ] **Room Search & Filtering** - Not implemented ❌

## Phase 5: Polish (Low Priority)

- [ ] **Emoji Reactions** - React to messages with emojis
- [ ] **Message Notifications** - Push notifications for new messages
- [ ] **Dark/Light Theme Support** - UI theme consistency
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimize for mobile devices

## Critical Migration Steps for Supabase Realtime ✅ FULLY COMPLETED

- [x] Replace Socket.io event listeners with Supabase real-time subscriptions ✅ (fully integrated)
- [x] Update `useSupabaseRealtime.ts` to handle message/room/presence events ✅ (active in production)
- [x] Modify API routes to trigger Supabase real-time updates instead of Socket.io emissions ✅ (broadcasting with listeners)
- [x] Update message state management to work with Supabase's real-time patterns ✅ (optimistic UI with real-time sync)

## Implementation Strategy

Start with Phase 1 to get the basic functionality working, then progressively add real-time features in Phase 2. This approach ensures you have a working chat system quickly while building up the advanced features.

## Notes

- All chat components are already built and just need to be uncommented
- Database models are fully designed in the Prisma schema
- API routes structure is complete but disabled
- Real-time hooks framework is in place but needs Supabase integration
