# Chat System Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation phases for migrating the existing chat system from Socket.io to Supabase realtime.

## Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

- [x] **Database Schema** - Uncomment and enable all chat models in Prisma schema ✅
- [x] **User Authentication Integration** - Ensure chat works with existing auth system ✅
- [x] **Basic Room Management** - Create/list rooms functionality (no join/invitations) ✅
- [x] **Core Messaging** - Send/receive text messages in rooms ✅
## Phase 2: Real-time Core (High Priority)

- [x] **Supabase Realtime Setup** - Basic message real-time updates ✅
- [x] **Message Broadcasting** - Real-time message delivery ✅
- [x] **Room State Sync** - Live room updates ✅
- [x] **Connection Management** - Handle connection states ✅

## Phase 3: User Experience (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **Room Invitations** - Invite users to join rooms
- [ ] **Message Pagination** - Load older messages
- [ ] **Typing Indicators** - Show who's typing
- [ ] **Online Presence** - Show who's online

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **File Attachments** - Send/receive files in chat
- [ ] **Message Editing/Deletion** - Edit or delete sent messages
- [ ] **Unread Message Tracking** - Track unread messages
- [ ] **Room Search & Filtering** - Search through rooms and messages

## Phase 5: Polish (Low Priority)

- [ ] **Emoji Reactions** - React to messages with emojis
- [ ] **Message Notifications** - Push notifications for new messages
- [ ] **Dark/Light Theme Support** - UI theme consistency
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimize for mobile devices

## Implementation Strategy

Start with Phase 1 to get the basic functionality working, then progressively add real-time features in Phase 2. This approach ensures you have a working chat system quickly while building up the advanced features.

## Notes

- All chat components are already built and just need to be uncommented
- Database models are fully designed in the Prisma schema  
- API routes structure is complete but disabled
- Real-time hooks framework is in place but needs Supabase integration
