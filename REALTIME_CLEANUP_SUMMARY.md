## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Strategy

### Error Types Handled
- `CONNECTION_FAILED`: Network connectivity issues
- `SUBSCRIPTION_ERROR`: Supabase subscription failures
- `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR`: Auth-related problems
- `TIMEOUT_ERROR`: Operation timeouts
- `NETWORK_ERROR`: General network issues
- `DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid data processing
- `MEMORY_LEAK_DETECTED`: Resource management issues
- `CLEANUP_ERROR`: Component cleanup failures

### Error Severity Levels
- `LOW`: Minor issues that don't affect functionality
- `MEDIUM`: Issues that may impact user experience
- `HIGH`: Significant problems requiring attention
- `CRITICAL`: System-threatening issues requiring immediate action

### Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Automatic Retry**: Exponential backoff with jitter
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to polling or offline mode
4. **User Notifications**: Clear error messages with recovery actions

## üßπ Cleanup and Memory Management

### Comprehensive Cleanup Strategy
1. **Timer Management**: All intervals and timeouts are properly cleared
2. **Channel Unsubscription**: Async cleanup with error handling
3. **State Reset**: Clean state management on unmount
4. **Memory Leak Detection**: Automatic detection and warnings
5. **Resource Tracking**: Monitoring of active subscriptions and connections

### Memory Leak Prevention
- Reference nullification after cleanup
- Async cleanup operation handling
- Timeout protection for cleanup operations
- Post-cleanup validation
- Memory usage monitoring

### Cleanup Verification
```typescript
// Example cleanup logging
console.log('üßπ Starting comprehensive subscription cleanup...');
// ... cleanup operations with detailed logging
console.log(`üßπ Subscription cleanup completed in ${duration}ms`);
console.log(`üìä Cleanup stats: ${timeouts} timeouts, ${channels} channels`);
```

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Connection Metrics Tracked
- Total errors by type
- Connection uptime

- Average latency
- Success rates

### Health Indicators
- Connection state (Connected, Connecting, Degraded, Failed)

- Circuit breaker status
- Recent error counts
- Last successful operation timestamp

## üîß Testing and Validation

```typescript
import { useRealtimeErrorHandling } from '@/lib/realtime/error-handling';

function MyComponent() {
  const { stats, lastError, logError } = useRealtimeErrorHandling();
  
  // Monitor connection health
  if (stats.connectionQuality === 'poor') {
    // Show degraded experience
  }
  
  // Handle errors
  if (lastError) {
    // Show user-friendly error message
  }
}
```
