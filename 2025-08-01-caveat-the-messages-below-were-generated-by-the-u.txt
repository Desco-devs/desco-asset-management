> check my current codebase for equipments creation of equipment 
  '/home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/REALTIME_PATTERN.md' if this 
  follow this. remember i want u jsut to check the creation of 
  equipment for now.

● I'll check your current equipment creation implementation
  against the realtime pattern document. Let me first read the
  realtime pattern guidelines and then examine the equipment
  creation code.

● Read(REALTIME_PATTERN.md)
  ⎿  Read 449 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/app/(admin-dashboard)/equipments/actions.ts)
  ⎿  Read 1123 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/app/(admin-dashboard)/equipments/components/forms/Creat
      eEquipmentForm.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 1349 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/app/api/equipments/route.ts)
  ⎿  Read 1367 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check the equipment query hook to understand the
  complete flow:

● Read(src/hooks/useEquipmentsQuery.ts)
  ⎿  Read 1343 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check if there's a specific equipment create mutation
   being used:

● Search(pattern: "useCreateEquipment", path: "src/hooks")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/hooks/useEquipmentQuery.ts)
  ⎿  Read 276 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me also check if there's a realtime hook for equipment:

● Search(pattern: "**/useEquipment*Realtime.ts")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/hooks/useEquipmentRealtime.ts)
  ⎿  Read 34 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on my analysis of your equipment creation codebase, I can
  see that your implementation does follow the realtime pattern 
  document quite well, but there are some areas where it could be
  improved. Here's my assessment:

  ✅ What Follows the Pattern:

  1. ✅ Separation of Concerns: Your implementation correctly
  separates:
    - UI Layer: Forms handle only UI state
    - Data Layer: TanStack Query manages server state with
  optimistic updates
    - Realtime Layer: Supabase realtime handles cache invalidation
  2. ✅ TanStack Query Integration: You have proper query hooks
  (useEquipments(), useCreateEquipment())
  3. ✅ Optimistic Updates: Your useCreateEquipment() hook
  implements optimistic updates correctly:
  onMutate: async (formData) => {
    // Creates optimistic equipment immediately
    const optimisticEquipment: Equipment = { ... }
    queryClient.setQueryData(equipmentKeys.list(), ...)
  }
  4. ✅ Simple Realtime: You have useEquipmentRealtime() that just
   invalidates cache
  5. ✅ File Structure: Follows the recommended structure with
  hooks and components separated

  ⚠️ Areas for Improvement:

  1. Multiple Query Systems (Complexity Issue)

  You have two different equipment query systems:
  - src/hooks/useEquipmentQuery.ts - Simple, follows pattern
  - src/hooks/useEquipmentsQuery.ts - Complex, with built-in
  realtime

  Recommendation: Use only the simple useEquipmentQuery.ts
  approach as it better follows the pattern.

  2. Form Uses Server Action Instead of API Route

  Your form calls createEquipmentAction (server action) but your
  query hook expects API route format.

  Recommendation: Either:
  - Use the API route approach (POST /api/equipments)
  consistently, OR
  - Update query hook to work with server actions

  3. Complex Realtime Implementation

  Your useEquipmentsQuery.ts has 500+ lines of complex realtime
  logic with error suppression, which violates the "Keep it
  simple" principle.

  Recommendation: Use the simple 30-line useEquipmentRealtime.ts
  approach instead.

  4. Missing Store for UI State

  The pattern recommends having a Zustand store for UI state
  (modals, filters), but your form manages everything internally.

  🎯 Quick Fixes to Better Follow Pattern:

  1. Simplify your realtime: Use only useEquipmentRealtime.ts
  2. Use one query system: Stick with useEquipmentQuery.ts
  3. Add UI store: Create equipmentStore.ts for modal/filter state
  4. Consistent API approach: Use either server actions OR API
  routes, not both

  📊 Pattern Compliance Score: 75/100

  Your implementation is mostly good but could be simplified to
  better follow the "simple and effective" principle of the
  realtime pattern document.

  Would you like me to help you refactor any specific part to
  better align with the pattern?

> ok do your proper revision on this and also delete all the 
  duplcaites cause its confusing other devs. here are some agents 
  that can help u for proper expertise '/home/tat/Desktop/desco-co
  mpany/.claude/agents/data-layer-specialist.md''/home/tat/Desktop
  /desco-company/.claude/agents/realtime-layer-specialist.md' 
  '/home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/.claude/agents/ui-layer-special
  ist.md' ok now  complete refactor. firrst delete all the 
  duplcaites cause this is confusing af. create a standard and 
  only one to avoid confusion pick the eright approach that will 
  improved performance but still simple and effective and follow 
  the golden rule

● I'll help you refactor the equipment creation system to properly
   follow the realtime pattern and eliminate all duplicates. Let
  me start by analyzing the specialist agents and then perform a
  complete refactor.

● Read(.claude/agents/data-layer-specialist.md)
  ⎿  Read 48 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(.claude/agents/realtime-layer-specialist.md)
  ⎿  Read 54 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(.claude/agents/ui-layer-specialist.md)
  ⎿  Read 53 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I'll perform a complete refactor following the
  realtime pattern's "GOLDEN RULE: Keep it simple, stupid!"
  principle. Let me start by creating a proper todo list and then
  systematically eliminate duplicates and implement the correct
  pattern.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze current duplicate systems and create elimination   
       plan
     ☐ Delete duplicate query hooks and keep only the simple one
     ☐ Create simple 30-line realtime hook following pattern
     ☐ Create UI store for equipment modal/filter state
     ☐ Update form to use standardized approach
     ☐ Test equipment creation end-to-end flow

● 🔍 Analysis Complete - Here's what I found:

  DUPLICATES TO ELIMINATE:
  1. useEquipmentsQuery.ts (1,343 lines) - Complex, violates "keep
   it simple"
  2. useEquipmentQuery.ts (276 lines) - Simple, follows pattern ✅
  3. Multiple realtime implementations with error suppression

  DECISION: Keep useEquipmentQuery.ts and eliminate the complex
  duplicate.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current duplicate systems and create elimination   
       plan
     ☐ Delete duplicate query hooks and keep only the simple one
     ☐ Create simple 30-line realtime hook following pattern
     ☐ Create UI store for equipment modal/filter state
     ☐ Update form to use standardized approach
     ☐ Test equipment creation end-to-end flow

● Now let me eliminate the duplicate complex query system:

● Bash(rm /home/tat/Desktop/desco-company/src/hooks/useEquipmentsQ
      uery.ts)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current duplicate systems and create elimination

     ☐ Create UI store for equipment modal/filter state
     ☐ Update form to use standardized approach
     ☐ Test equipment creation end-to-end flow

● Now let me call the realtime-layer-specialist to create the
  proper simple realtime hook:

● realtime-layer-specialist(Create simple realtime hook)

● Now let me call the data-layer-specialist to create the
  equipment UI store:

● data-layer-specialist(Create equipment UI store)
  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 41.9k tokens · 52.8s)

     ☐ Update form to use standardized approach
     ☐ Test equipment creation end-to-end flow

● Now let me update the form to use the standardized approach.
  First, let me check what imports need to be updated:

● Search(pattern: "useCreateEquipment", path: "src")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me call the ui-layer-specialist to update the form to use
  the correct standardized approach:

● ui-layer-specialist(Update form to use standardized approach)
  ⎿  Done (240 tool uses · 103.5k tokens · 44m 53.3s)             

● Now let me check if there are any remaining imports to fix:

● Search(pattern: "useEquipmentsQuery", path: "src")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 
  ⎿  Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 9pm 
     (Asia/Manila).
